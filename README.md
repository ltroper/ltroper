I'm a software developer with a passion for React, Redux, Flask, and SQL. My main project right now is Spaggiari, an app for exchanging cryptocurrencies, that relies on a React.js frontend combined with a python and flask backend. On the side, I'm currently working on an NFT project based around a simple gaming platform.

On a more personal note, I'm a trained musician, producer and engineer, and composer. I have released much of my own music on streaming platforms, and have performed as a session guitarist for different artists.

Wether it's art history, sports, music, physics, languages, or software engineering, I have an extremely wide array of interests that have allowed me to develop a knack for learning. Iâ€™m happy I'm able to do that with software development. I love learning new technology and challenging myself to think logically, methodically, and creatively.

As a full stack software developer, I have enjoyed using JavaScript, React/Redux, Flask, Python, PostgreSQL, CSS, and HTML in my projects. Currently, I'm self-learning smart contracts, game engineering, Russian, and playing the piano. I'm always finding time to learn more!
